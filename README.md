# WebGL-Slime-Simulation

This slime simulation was inspired by [Coding Adventure: Ant and Slime Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A) whose repository can be found here [Slime-Simulation](https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation).

This implementation was written using WebGL2 so that it can be played with interactively in the browser.
